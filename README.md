# El Niño Forecasting Project
Welcome to our El Niño forecasting project repository! This collaborative effort, undertaken during the second year of our Data Science Bachelor's degree with my colleagues Pedro Melo and Tomás Gomes, explores the prediction of El Niño occurrences and related patterns.

The project, conducted in Portuguese, follows the CRISP-DM methodology, employing both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Despite the inherent unpredictability of El Niño as a natural disaster, our aim was to uncover discernible patterns.

Check out the codebase, and don't miss our comprehensive report in Portuguese, summarizing conclusions and detailing the processes involved.
